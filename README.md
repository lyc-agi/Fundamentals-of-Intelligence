摘要：从智能的新定义——“做出确定性选择的能力”出发，可以推导出智能的宏观定义——“高效利用资源达到某种目的的能力”。智能之所以能够高效利用资源是因为智能能够充分发挥事物的特性，而事物是通过与其他事物联系而体现特性的，因此智能其实是在使事物与其他事物充分产生联系。

Abstract: From the new definition of intelligence as "the ability to make deterministic choices," a macro definition of intelligence can be derived as "the ability to efficiently utilize resources to achieve a certain purpose." Intelligence can efficiently utilize resources because it can fully exploit the characteristics of things, which manifest through their connections with other things. Thus, intelligence is essentially about making things fully connect with one another.
