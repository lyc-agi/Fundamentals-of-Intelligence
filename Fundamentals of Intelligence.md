### Fundamentals of Intelligence

**Author: Liu Yichuan**  

**Abstract:** From the new definition of intelligence as "the ability to make deterministic choices," a macro definition of intelligence can be derived as "the ability to efficiently utilize resources to achieve a certain purpose." Intelligence can efficiently utilize resources because it can fully exploit the characteristics of things, which manifest through their connections with other things. Thus, intelligence is essentially about making things fully connect with one another.

#### 1. Introduction

Currently, artificial intelligence has made significant progress, but our understanding of the principles of intelligence remains fragmented and superficial. This paper redefines intelligence as the ability to make deterministic choices, providing a basis for deriving and explaining the fundamental principles of intelligence.

#### 2. Definition of Intelligence

Intelligence is the ability to make deterministic choices. Everything has its own characteristics and can make deterministic choices (e.g., atoms choosing which atoms to combine with), hence everything has intelligence. As long as deterministic choices are made, regardless of correctness, it is intelligence because even mistakes are a form of deterministic choice. Only when something is in a specific environment and facing a particular goal can right and wrong be distinguished. Mistakes merely indicate a lower level of intelligence, and there is no absolute mistake; every result given by a thing is meaningful.

Imagine a machine that judges right from wrong and always outputs "right" regardless of the input. Since it makes deterministic choices, it possesses intelligence, albeit with minimal value. This merely reflects a low level of intelligence or incomplete manifestation, not a lack of intelligence. Absolute randomness, which doesn't exist in the universe and is unimaginable, represents a total absence of intelligence. Even in seemingly random cases, aspects such as physical characteristics remain deterministic.

#### 3. Levels of Intelligence

Although everything has intelligence, there are different levels of intelligence. The lowest level is the intelligence of matter, which refers to matter's ability to make choices based on its nature. Higher levels of intelligence arise from the combination of lower-level intelligence through connections. Combinations are also without distinction between right and wrong; any combination of lower-level intelligence generates intelligence surpassing its own level. Higher-level intelligence, composed of lower-level intelligence, can perform tasks that the latter finds difficult due to qualitative changes from quantitative changes, known as emergence. Understanding emergence is key to comprehending the principles of intelligence, which will be analyzed in detail later.

#### 4. Degree of Intelligence

The degree of intelligence is related to the environment. The same intelligence may exhibit vastly different degrees in different environments, fundamentally because the purposes that intelligence needs to achieve differ. Therefore, the criterion for judging the degree of intelligence is that the fewer resources required to achieve the same purpose, the higher the degree of intelligence. Resources include everything: matter, energy, information, time, etc. Thus, the macro definition of intelligence can be given as: Intelligence is the ability to efficiently utilize resources to achieve a certain purpose. All intelligence is efficient; even the lowest level of intelligence is more efficient than absolute randomness. Lower-level intelligence (resources themselves) can accomplish everything that higher-level intelligence can, but with extremely low efficiency, requiring massive resources. The existence of higher-level intelligence is to improve efficiency.

#### 5. How Intelligence Improves Efficiency

Resources cannot be created or change their characteristics out of thin air. Thus, the fundamental way intelligence improves efficiency is by enabling resources to fully manifest their characteristics and thereby function optimally. The meaning of "intelligence has no right or wrong, only degrees" lies in this: each intelligence has its role, but in its natural state, it does not occupy the most suitable position and cannot fully function, sometimes even hindering other intelligences. This results in differences in intelligence degrees. The process of intelligent development is complex; sometimes hindering some intelligences might better facilitate overall development. However, the overall trend remains unchanged. Full and partial manifestations of things' characteristics are both deterministic choices. Why is partial intelligence of a lower degree? Because it contradicts the nature of things. Things exist because they are not absolutely random and have their characteristics. Not fully manifesting their characteristics brings them closer to absolute randomness.

Things can only manifest their characteristics through connections with other things. The process of manifesting their characteristics is also the process of forming connections. The tighter the connection, the more fully the characteristics are manifested. Thus, the process of intelligence fully manifesting the characteristics of things is also the process of making things fully connected. Intelligence achieves this through various methods, including but not limited to the following categories:

##### 5.1 Finding Shortcuts

The precondition for intelligence to improve efficiency is that resources have the potential to be efficiently utilized, manifested as being rule-based. Rules allow for shortcuts to achieve goals. For example, multiplication is faster than addition for computing the sum of identical numbers. All knowledge is a shortcut. A common definition of intelligence as "the ability to solve problems using knowledge" reflects the method of improving efficiency through shortcuts. "Being rule-based" is a characteristic of resources, and intelligence manifests this characteristic by discovering and utilizing rules.

A shortcut is essentially a connection hindered in a low-level intelligence state. A typical example is the internet. Even without the internet, everything in the world is interconnected by an invisible web, but it has significant limitations, such as slow information dissemination and weak connections. The internet enhances and creates many connections, allowing faster information spread and better manifestation of various characteristics.

Some scholars believe the essence of intelligence is prediction, finding shortcuts to the future. Reasoning ability, largely a core aspect of intelligence, also reflects shortcuts. For example, intelligence can improve accuracy through reasoning, such as calculating the trajectory of a missile to reduce ammunition needs.

##### 5.2 Making Resources Perform Multiple Functions

Intelligence cannot increase resources out of thin air, so efficient utilization inevitably involves reusing resources, making them connect with more resources to perform multiple functions. Resources inherently have this potential, and intelligence merely realizes it.

In any efficient system, components almost always perform multiple functions. For example, a gear in a machine receives force from a previous gear and drives the next gear, performing at least two functions. In a parts library, it cannot perform so many functions. Intelligence's role is to find positions where resources can perform their multiple functions.

##### 5.3 Resolving Conflicts

Due to the limitations of lower-level intelligence, the process of resources manifesting their characteristics involves conflicts. The significance of intelligence is to coordinate these conflicts. For instance, some things unsuitable for the environment should be eliminated but are important in the long term and should be preserved. Because intelligence has foresight, connecting the future with the present, it will maintain the existence of such things.

#### 6. Internal Principles of Intelligence

Improving efficiency is the external function of intelligence. Below is an analysis of the internal principles of intelligence. Internally, intelligence also reflects efficient resource utilization. The core question is how low-level intelligence within intelligence generates high-level intelligence through efficient combination. As previously mentioned, emergence is key to solving this issue.

Emergence refers to phenomena where a whole composed of multiple parts exhibits new properties that none of the parts possess, meaning "the whole is greater than the sum of its parts." Any two low-level intelligences are considered a whole if connected, but the degree of wholeness varies. Suppose there are six planks. When these planks are put together (or connected differently), their combined effect exceeds the sum of their individual effects, creating higher-level intelligence. This is because things manifest their characteristics through connections with others. The connection is mutual, meaning while manifesting its characteristics, a thing helps its connected counterpart manifest its characteristics. This reciprocal process continuously strengthens, surpassing the original level of the things. This is the essence of emergence.

Different combination methods lead to different overall characteristics, producing various intelligences. How do we judge the degree of these intelligences? Internally, the more a combination method manifests the characteristics of things, the higher the efficiency and intelligence degree. Externally, we must consider the environment and purpose. For example, randomly piling planks seems less characteristic than making a box. However, in war, using it as a decoy (e.g., simulating a bunker) might be more effective than a box, thus more intelligent.

Therefore, judging the intelligence degree of a whole requires considering both internal and external factors. In fact, the need to consider the external environment stems from our developmental limitations: currently, not necessarily the more a thing's characteristics are manifested, the more intelligent it is. We must consider whether other things' characteristics are also manifested. Only when intelligence reaches its highest stage will fully manifesting characteristics always equate to higher intelligence.

#### 7. Conclusion

Summarizing the principles of intelligence is challenging due to the immense diversity and complexity of intelligence, requiring exceptional insight and inductive ability, and partly summarizing the unified laws of the world. This paper proposes some new viewpoints, but deeper research on the principles of intelligence is still necessary.
